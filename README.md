My project is to help everyone to be safe without them themselfs doing it because it is hard and very fustrating. We may release a GUI version but not yet I am planning on making a GUI version we are working on it.
    Just click on my profile and then click repositories and there it is GUI security scanner. Disclaimer: Don't use this tool or GUI tool to scan a network that is not you're network 
            and this is illegal to scan on network you have permission 
                    or that is yours.
and GUI may not work it is like beta or experimental release.
        
        Edit: always use sudo for running because if not it will not run.
