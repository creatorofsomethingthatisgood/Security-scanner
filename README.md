My project is to help everyone to be safe without them themselfs doing it because it is hard and very fustrating we may release a GUI version but not yet I am planning on making a GUI version we are working on it.
    Just click on my profile and then click repositories and there it is GUI security scanner. Disclaimer: Don't use this tool or GUI tool to scan a network that is not you're network 
            and this is illegal to scan on network you have permission 
                    or that is yours.
